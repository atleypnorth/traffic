Download and looking at traffic flow data


# What is big data?

* Bigger than a GB ?
* Bigger than a TB ?
* Bigger than the memory on your PC?
* Bigger than the size of your hard drive?

# Get some data

Lets try to get some data that is larger than the size of my PC memory - motorway flow data

# Now what? 

* Need to download and clean up your data - how to do it when you have lots of data?
* Discover your data ... work out how to get it since it probably wont be straight forward
* Websites are generally made to look nice, rather than easy to download data, so have to do some quick hacking about
* Write some code in Python to do it!
* Then you can load it up in memory etc using Pandas and so how it works
* As you get bigger you will need to look at databases of some sort ..
